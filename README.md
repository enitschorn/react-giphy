# react-giphy-app

We are going to build a simple app that integrates with Giphy to show a list of gifs, based on some search string.

## Specs

Your app should have the following features:

- Think about the component structure in the app. Try immutable first (model data with props).
- The user should be able to click on one of the gifs on the right sidebar to make it appear in the left area
- The list of gifs should change when the user types a search string

You will need to get an api key from https://developers.giphy.com/ and to interact with the API there's a NPM package for that:

```bash
yarn add giphy-api
```
